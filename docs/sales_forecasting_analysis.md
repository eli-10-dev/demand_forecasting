	- Both Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Weighted Moving Average (WMA) forecast an increase in sales for the upcoming week. SMA projects a slight pullback in the second week and stabilization thereafter, while WMA anticipates a continued increase over the next two weeks before a slight decrease.
	- Based on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), WMA shows a slightly lower error compared to SMA, suggesting that it better captures recent fluctuations. Given the volatility observed in the past 4–5 weeks, WMA may be more suitable for short-term planning as it responds more quickly to recent changes in sales patterns.
